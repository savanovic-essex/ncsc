# About

This web application is a team project that was implemented as a part of the Secure Software Development course at the University of Essex Online. It represents a proposed solution for the Dutch National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) as a department under the National Coordinator of Counterterrorism and Security of the Government of the Netherlands to manage cases of suspected internet crime in accordance with the national counterterrorism and cybersecurity policy (Government of the Netherlands, N.D.). In addition, the NCSC helps public authorities in providing information about new IT software and hardware trends and updates which is also part of the application.Also, there is a page reserved for reporting cybersecurity threats that can be accessed by the general public. In general, the focus is on functionality and security. Functionality is manifested in simple CRUD operations. Security relies on the principle of “Defense in Depth”. This application was build using Firebase platform and ReactJS library, in addition to other tools for implementation and testing. More information are available at [Getting Started with Create React App](#getting-started-with-create-react-app), and [Learn more about Firebase](#learn-more-about-firebase) sections.


# User Guide

For a detailed application user guide, please refer to this link: [User Guide](https://github.com/savanovic-essex/ncsc/blob/2ac97cd42232462204e3beda0c6cf356039ed21e/userguide/UserGuide.md)



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
