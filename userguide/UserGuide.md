### Submit a Public Report

This page is reserved for public use. It can be accessed by any individual of the general public who is willing to submit a suspected cybersecurity threat for review by a cyber security specialist. The public report submission page looks like the following:

### Cyber Specialist Dashboard

#### Login

User accounts for the security specialists are managed by the superadmin through [Firbase Authenticaiton](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth). Two factor authentication is required by the users to be able to access their accounts, a password that they create after receiving a password reset email, and an OTP that they receive on their mobile devices. The login page looks like the following:

After successful login, the cyber specialist will be directed to a dashboard that contains three main divisions. One for private reports, the second one for authorities and the third for IT updates. The dashboard looks like the following:
